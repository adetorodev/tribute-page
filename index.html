        <br>
        <li><b>1991</b>- Born in Cresco, Iowa</li>
        <br>
        <li><b>1993</b> - Leaves his family's farm to attend the University of Minnesota, thanks to a Depression era
          program known as the "National Youth Administration"</li>
        <br>
        <li><b>1995</b> - Has to stop school and save up more money. Works in the Civilian Conservation Corps, helping
          starving Americans. "I saw how food changed them", he said. "All of this left scars on me."</li>
        <br>
        <li><b>1997</b> - Tries to enroll in the military after the Pearl Harbor attack, but is rejected. Instead, the
          military asked his lab to work on waterproof glue, DDT to control malaria, disinfectants, and other applied
          science.</li>
        <br>
        <li><b>1986</b> - NeXT was not, however, the end of Steve Jobs. In 1986 Jobs purchased a small company called
          Pixar from filmmaker George Lucas (1944–). Pixar specialized in computer animation. Nine years later Pixar
          released Toy Story, a huge box office hit. Pixar later went on to make Toy Story 2 and A Bug's Life, which
          Disney distributed, and Monsters, Inc. All these films have been extremely successful. Monsters, Inc. had the
          largest opening weekend ticket sales of any animated film in history.</li>
        <br>
        <li><b>1996</b> - In a February 1996 Time magazine article, Jobs said, "The thing that drives me and my
          colleagues … is that you see something very compelling to you, and you don't quite know how to get it, but you
          know, sometimes intuitively, it's within your grasp. And it's worth putting in years of your life to make it
          come into existence." Jobs has worked hard to translate his ideas into exciting and innovative products for
          businesses and consumers. He was instrumental in launching the age of the personal computer. Steve Jobs is
          truly a computer industry visionary. <br>In December of 1996 Apple purchased NeXT Software for over $400
          million. Jobs returned to Apple as a part-time consultant to the chief executive officer (CEO). The following
          year, in a surprising event, Apple entered into a partnership with its competitor Microsoft. The two
          companies, according to the New York Times, "agreed to cooperate on several sales and technology fronts." Over
          the next six years Apple introduced several new products and marketing strategies.</li>
        <br>
        <li><b>1997</b> - In November 1997 Jobs announced Apple would sell computers directly to users over the Internet
          and by telephone. The Apple Store became a runaway success. Within a week it was the third-largest e-commerce
          site on the Internet. In September of 1997 Jobs was named interim CEO of Apple.<br>
          In 1998 Jobs announced the release of the iMac, which featured powerful computing at an affordable price. The
          iBook was unveiled in July 1999. This is a clam-shaped laptop that is available in bright colors. It includes
          Apple's AirPort, a computer version of the cordless phone that would allow the user to surf the Internet
          wirelessly. In January 2000 Jobs unveiled Apple's new Internet strategy. It included a group of Macintosh-only
          Internet-based applications. Jobs also announced that he was becoming the permanent CEO of Apple.</li>
        <br>
        <li><b>2005</b> - Steve Jobs with his Apple team began work on the first iPhone in 2005 and the first iPhone was
          released on June 29, 2007. The iPhone created such a sensation that a survey indicated six out of ten
          Americans were aware of its release. Time declared it "Invention of the Year" for 2007.</li>
        <br>
        <li><b>1996</b> - In a February 1996 Time magazine article, Jobs said, "The thing that drives me and my
          colleagues … is that you see something very compelling to you, and you don't quite know how to get it, but you

          <li><b>2011</b> - Jobs died at his Palo Alto, California home around 3 p.m. (PDT) on October 5, 2011, due to complications from a relapse of his previously treated islet-cell pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor,which resulted in respiratory arrest. He had lost consciousness the day before and died with his wife, children, and sisters at his side. His sister, Mona Simpson, described his death thus: "Steve's final words, hours earlier, were monosyllables, repeated three times. Before embarking, he'd looked at his sister Patty, then for a long time at his children, then at his life's partner, Laurene, and then over their shoulders past them. Steve's final words were: 'Oh wow. Oh wow. Oh wow.'" He then lost consciousness and died several hours later. A small private funeral was held on October 7, 2011, the details of which, out of respect for Jobs's family, were not made public.</li>
